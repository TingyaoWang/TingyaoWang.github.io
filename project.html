        <h1>A positive perspective of the economy of the UK</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The UK, which is the world's sixth largest economy as measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and the second largest economy in the world as measured by GDP per capita, accounts for 3.3% of the world's nominal GDP. (<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom">'WIKIPEDIA'</a>). It is widely regarded as having a high quality of life and a fairly diverse economy. However, many professionals have recently indicated that the UK is in recession. I use the ONS API to download the time series of the UK’s GDP and then create a line chart (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12GZz64GX19EIOOzMhTLqTsLwQCSuacPo#scrollTo=LW42fGAxzd16">'COLAB'</a>).</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        <p>Figure 1 indicates that the UK economy appears to be shrinking as a result of a 0.3% decline in the fourth quarter of 2022. Despite this, I still want to look at the UK economy in a positive light. Therefore, I will discuss the UK's high-quality higher education and clean political environment.</p>

        <h2>Tertiary Education</h2>
        <p>I scraped the ranking of universities around the world from <a href="https://www.webometrics.info/en/distribution_by_country">'Ranking Web of Universities'</a>. Here is my <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JvuWnl49MRvbMW_kRn7pURm6y1S0PWIi#scrollTo=R0GQp7Ny3oSz">'COLAB'</a>. </p>
        <p>Then I cleaned the data in Excel to get countries with the top 200 universities.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
        <p>Figure 2 shows the UK has the second-highest number of the top 200 universities in the world.</p>

        <p>I downloaded the CSV file of the gross enrollment ratio of tertiary education from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/tertiary-education">'Our World in Data'</a>.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        <p>Although Figure 3 shows that the UK does not stand out among these countries, I got the UK’s ratio in the above data and made a new CSV file to obtain the trend of the UK higher education gross enrolment rate. Figure 4 shows the trend is growing.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        
        <p>I used the data above and obtained GDP values from <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp">'Trading Economics'</a>. I input these values by hand since the number of countries I need is not too many and this website is easy to search these values.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        <p>Figure 5 shows there is a positive relationship between the three variables. </p>

        
        <h2>Political Environment</h2>
        <p>I scraped the corruption index and GPD per capita from <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/corruption-index">'Trading Economics'</a>. </p>
        <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/107_hXJU4VCNHR9Lbvz_jeTktBGEx_Kcn#scrollTo=sccf-IXhKtF8">'COLAB'</a></p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>
        <p>This graph shows that there is a positive relationship between the corruption index and GPD per capita. </p>


        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>When creating the regression on the corruption index and GDP per capita, although I was able to get them easily in the TIDY format using python, the data in the two charts did not match each other: for example, some countries only had GDP per capita data but no corruption index. Finally, I used the VLOOKUP function in Excel to match the data and then manually removed the countries and regions with blank data.</p>
        <p>When working with the data on enrollment ratio, I needed to match the ratios with countries that had the Top 200 universities. I used the SUMIF and LOOKUP functions in Excel to query and match the data.</p>
        <p>The data for enrollment ratio is from 1971 to 2014, however, the top 200 universities list is updated in 2021. To eliminate the year mismatch, I used Excel to get an average value of the enrollment ratio for each country.</p>



        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The number of top 200 universities in the UK is evidence of the quality of higher education in the UK. Also, the bubble chart with the regression line shows that higher education has a positive correlation with GDP. This may suggest that the quality of higher education in the UK will lead to another positive trend in the UK economy. Also, the high corruption index in the UK implies that the UK has a clean political environment and by regressing we also realize that the UK's economic strength is positively related to its clean political environment. I believe that education is the future of a country and a clean political environment is the foundation of a stable economy. When a country is politically clean, the social costs will be minimal and there will be a virtuous cycle in the economy. Thus, although the UK economy may seem to be shrinking, the future and foundations of the country are still in place, so what is there to worry about?</p>
